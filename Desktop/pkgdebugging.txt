	This is from Tim Knitter on how to debug packages procedure scripts.

	If you found errors in upgrade_log or install_log and you want to find out what is going on, you can do the following:

	Look at bugid 4635483 as a good example for debugging pkginstall and pkgremove with Java packages.

If you want to do debugging under Miniroot during install time, you can do the following:

	cd Solaris_<release>/Tools/Boot/usr/sadm/install/bin

	or

	cd /usr/sadm/install/bin

1.  cp pkgremove pkgremove.exe
2.  Replace pkgremove with the following shell script:

#!/bin/ksh

args=$*

/usr/sadm/install/bin/pkgremove.exe -v $args


3.  cp pkginstall pkginstall.exe
4.  Replace pkginstall with the following shell script:

#!/bin/ksh

args=$*

/usr/sadm/install/bin/pkginstall.exe -v $args



Upgrade with Disk Space realloation is a good test case to do.  Basically we back up the /var/sadm/ and other files.  Then we relayout the file system and do newfs , restore the cpio backup and then do execute the upgrade script.  We do all the pkgrms and removef and then pkgadd all the packages just like new install.

Doing pkgrm and pkgadd with -v option is the best way to see how the various install and remove scripts are execised and discovered bugs.

We also support pkgadd on hetergeneous servers and we can do packaging commands on sparc servers with x86 packages and vice versa.  Look at bugid 4891412 for details.
